Dear all, I want to let all you that I'm leaving the company. I have really liked working here and appreciate all of you for your support (specialy Roshel aiya and Sameera aiya). You have helped in times of need and I will always remember all of you. I joined to CyberElysium as an intern, but I learned lot of things more than that level.
The time I have spent in this company will be cherished by me forever. Hope to keep in touch with all of you. Thank you all for everything. Best wishes for all of you.
